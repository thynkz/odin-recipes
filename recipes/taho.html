    <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>16 oz silken tofu</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>1 cup tapioca or sago pearls</li>
        </ul></p>
    <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the tapioca pearls according to your package instructions. This can be done in advance; just be sure to store the prepped pearls with some water or a little brown sugar syrup (next step).</li>
            <li>Combine the brown sugar, water, and vanilla in a small saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stir to dissolve the sugar, and lower heat to a simmer. Continue simmering for about 2-4 minutes and remove from heat. This syrup, or arnibal, can also be made in advance.</li>
            <li>Place silken tofu in a parchment lined steamer. Steam for 10-15 minutes, or until heated through. Alternatively, you can microwave the tofu for about 2-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>To serve, scoop slices of warm silken tofu into a small cup. Top with tapioca or sago pearls. Pour hot brown sugar syrup (arnibal) on top. Serve immediately, while warm.</li>
